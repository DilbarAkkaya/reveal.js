				<section>WELCOME TO PRESENTATION
					<p>TOPIC: Computer Architecture</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Technology</h3>
					<ul>The technology is moving very quickly
						<li>19th century: attempts to build
							mechanical computers</li>
						<li>Early 20 th century: mechanical computers</li>
						<li>Mid 20 th century: vacuum tubes as switches</li>
						<li>Since: transistors, integrated circuits</li>

				<section>HISTORY
					<section><img src="examples/assets/babbage.jpg"  height="100" width="100">
						<p>CHARLES BABBAGE</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In the early 1800’s Charles Babbage
								designed two machines: first the Difference
								Engine and then the Analytical Engine
								that were mechanical machines capable of
								performing calculations.</li>
							<li>The Difference Engine, most (but not all) of
								which was built in Babbage’s time, was a
								special purpose machine (i.e. it could only
								do particular calculations).</li>
							<li>The Analytical Engine, which was designed
								but not built in Babbage’s time, was more
								ambitious in that it was programmable.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section><img src="examples/assets/Eniac.jpg"  height="250" width="250">
					<p>In the 1940’s the Electronic Numerical
						Integrator And Computer (ENIAC) was built at
						the Moore School of the University of Pennsylvania.
						It was completed in 1946 at the Moore School of the
						University of Pennsylvania.</p></section>

						<p>The two driving forces behind it were John W.
						Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert.
						There were other computers built during WWII
						notably the one developed at Bletchley Park, UK to
						aid in their code breaking mission.</p></section>
					<section>ENIAC
						<p>The ENIAC consisted of 17,480 vacuum tubes operating
							at 100,000 pulses per second.
							Vacuum tubes play the same role that transistors do
							in modern computers (one can use them to “realize”
							logic gates (вентили))
							The switch from vacuum tubes to transistors marked a dramatic
							shift in computer size and speed.
							The Pentium 4 processor introduced in 2000 had 42,000,000
							transistors. The Itanium 2 in 2004 had 592,000,000 transistors.
							The more recent Core i7 processor has a transistor count is 731
							Million.</p>

				<section>SERVERS
					<img src="examples/assets/SERVERS.jpg"  height="200" width="200">
					<ul>
						<li>Computers connected in a network environment.</li>
						<li>Manage network resources</li>
						<li>Holds and delivers an organization’s web pages</li>
						<li>Stores and retrieves tasks for all of an organization’s files</li>
						<li>A printer server handles all print requests.</li>
				  </ul>
				</section>
				<section>MAIN FRAMES
					<ul>
						<li>First computers, introduced in 1950s</li>
						<li>Used primarily by large organizations for critical applications, bulk data processing</li>
						<li>Used by large businesses</li>
						<li>Typically supported hundreds or thousands of users</li>
						<li>Very expensive</li>
						<li>Used for very large processing tasks</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="examples/assets/main.jpg"  height="200" width="200">
				</section>
				<section>MINICOMPUTERS
					<ul>
						<li>Typically supported hundreds of users</li>
						<li>No longer a product line</li>
						<li>Smaller and less expensive than mainframes</li>
						<li>The real difference is relative in terms of price, power, marketing.</li>
					</ul>

					<section>MAIN COMPONENTS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS
						<ul>
							<li>Processor (CPU)
							Runs program instructions</li>
							<li>Main Memory
							Storage for running programs and current data</li>
							<li>Secondary Storage</li>
							Long-term program & data storage (hard disk, CD, etc)
							<li>Input Devices</li>
							Communication from the user to the computer(e.g.
							keyboard, mouse)
							<li>Output Devices</li>
							Communication from the computer to the user (e.g.
							, printer, speakers)
							</ul>
					</section>
					<section>MOTHERBOARD
						<p>A motherboard is the central printed
						circuit board (PCB) in many modern
						computers and holds many of the crucial
						components of the system, while
						providing
						connectors
						for
						other
						peripherals. The motherboard can be
						easily compared to the human body’s
						nervous system. The wires (nerves) on it
						transfer data between all of the other
						components.</p>
					</section>
					<section>THE PROCESSOR
						<p>The processor is the "brain" of the computer system.
Main processor is called the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
A particular computer will have a particular type of
processor, such as a Pentium or a SPARC chip.
Co-processors assist the CPU with some of the processing
functions.</p> <p>Examples:
Math co-processors handle heavy duty math processing
Graphics coprocessors speed up the display of graphics
onto the monitor</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						MEMORY
						<p>Computer Memory
							- millions/billions of on/off charges
							Divided into:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Bits
									0 or 1</li>
									<li>Bytes
									Groups of 8 bits
									A byte is the smallest unit of storage.
									(Can hold one text character)</li>
									<li>Words
									Groups of bits/bytes (8, 16, 32, 64-bits)</li>
							</ul>
